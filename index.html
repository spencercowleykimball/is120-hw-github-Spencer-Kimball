<!-- Include a single HTML comment at the top of your file explaining your choice
 of elements and general page structure:

I used the header, main, section, and footer options for this assignment. 
I liked having the product, purchasing, and specifications be their own sections since
they have their own H3 tags. 

I have added unique id's for the section in
hopes of helping with navigation, as well as alt tags for accessibility concerns.
The footer includes the customer support information since that seems to be
best practice for big companies' websites these days. I also included a link
to the actual product page so you can see how cool they make the paddle look.

            <!-- Give any emphasis or strong importance to text where it makes sense -->
            The <strong>Boom</strong>stik has a limited lifetime warranty as well as a 30 day free return policy.
            <br>
            The <strong>Boom</strong>stik provides more <strong>power</strong> for your stroke, and <em>3(X)</em> as much spin due to the new <strong>INFINIGRIT</strong>.
            <br>
            The <strong>Boom</strong>stik is built with the new BoomCore! 
            <br>
            The <strong>Boom</strong>Core is created using PureFoam surrounded by an EVA Power Ring and fused together.

            The <strong>Boom</strong>stik is currently used by former tennis pro <strong>Jack Sock</strong>!

             how many people are buying these paddles at this price, even though there
             are the very cheap $20 paddle options out there. I currently own the boomstik
             and it does feel way better than the $20 options. However, there are a few
             $150 paddles out there that are arguably fairly similar in quality.  -->
